# Dipole Simulation using Manim
# Implementation of an electric dipole from scratch using Maxwell's equations and animating the result in Manim
The electric dipole setup and the corresponding field is done in `Dipole_Sim.py` and is imported for animation in Manim in `DipoleField.py`

Dipole Sim is the code with Field and potential functions used for the simulation in DipoleFIeld.
